README for Assigment 5 - PCA with average rainfall data

The data to be used in this program comes from the file values.hpp which has the two separated values
for the rainfall from January and June. The file was not created by me.
The Eigen Library was used in order to calculate and set up a Covariance Matrix
and calculate the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors for the Principal Components discovered.

To Build and Run:

Typing "make" in console will build the project.
It can be run by typing "./pca" which is the name of the executable created by the Makefile

Furthermore the .o files and executable as well as the answers text file can be removed
from the folder by typing "make clean".

The answers to the questions set in the Assignment brief are written to a file
that is created, called answers.txt.
